# Depth Face Recognition

## Description

This repository contains code for a face recognition project that uses depth data captured from an RGBD sensor. It calculates dissimilarity between two faces based on the depth information.

## Installation and Running
1. pip install requiremnts.txt 

2. **Build C++ Project**: Navigate to your project directory and execute the following to build `project34topixel.cpp`:
    cmake CMakeLists.txt && make && ./bin/project3dtopixel

2. **Data Conversion**: Go to the `conversion.ipynb` notebook to convert the dataset for preprocessing and training.

3. **Train and Test Model**: Open `train_test.ipynb` to train and test the model.
